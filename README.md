# A TensorFlow project to process raw audio with LSTMs.

High level description available in [the blog post](https://michaelwoodson.github.io/learning-to-whistle-with-an-lstm-gan/).

Details about parameters in [default_params.yaml](https://github.com/michaelwoodson/scrynet/blob/master/default_params.yaml).

Main entry point is `train.py` (trains model and generates samples).

Project was forked from [scrynet](https://github.com/michaelwoodson/scrygan)

Which was based on the [Tensorflow WaveNet Implementation](https://github.com/ibab/tensorflow-wavenet).

GAN implementation taken from [DCGAN in Tensorflow](https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow).
